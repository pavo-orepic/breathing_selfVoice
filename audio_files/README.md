*A_voice.wav* & *B_voice.wav* are examples of unmorphed voice recordings of a pair of subjects saying 10 words in French. *loudness_example.wav*
is the example of all sound intensity levels for the stimuli of word 1 used in loudness task.

Each numerical folder (1 - 10) represents experimental stimuli for 1 of those 10 words. Each word's subfolders *voice* and *loudness* represent 
experimental stimuli (voice morphs) for self-other and loudness tasks, respectively. Names of the files in the *voice* subfolder indicate
self-voice ratio of subject B in the corresponding voice morph. Names of the files in the *loudness* subfolder indicate sound intensity level
(dBFS) of the 50% self-voice morph.
